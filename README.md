# VCSTest

## 📝 Project Description

In this project, you and your teammates will work **collaboratively using Git and GitHub** to build a simple portfolio website that showcases each team member. The goal is to give you hands-on experience with real-world version control practices including **branching, merging, stash, tags, remotes**, and more.

Each member will contribute an individual "About Me" section in the form of a separate HTML page, while working in their own Git branch. Once your section is ready, you’ll open a **pull request (PR)**, get it reviewed by a teammate, and merge it into the main project — just like developers do in real projects!
